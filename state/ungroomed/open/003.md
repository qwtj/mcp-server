config.loadAllowlist() silently eats errors on startup and leaves `_allowlist` empty. Operators may not realise the file failed to parse.

**Recommendation:** Log a warning via `auditLogger` or `console.warn` when the initial load fails. Consider allowing a default-deny policy to avoid running with no allowlist.
