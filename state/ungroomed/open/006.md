The `/run-tool` HTTP endpoint returns `400 Bad Request` for all errors, making it hard for clients to distinguish between client-side input mistakes and server-side faults.

**Recommendation:** Differentiate error responses (e.g., `400` for invalid input, `403` for denied tools, `500` for internal errors) and document the behavior in the API spec.
