auditLogger.logEvent performs synchronous writes and propagates any fs error. A disk full or permission error in production would crash the process.

**Recommendation:** Wrap `appendFileSync` in try/catch and fallback to `console.error` (or return a boolean). Add a unit test simulating write failure.
