If any exist, this indicates unplanned work was discovered during project discovery that needs to be triaged before issue intake. Recommend opening a spike issue to investigate and groom this work before proceeding with issue intake.\n+\n+In addition, the intake agent should treat the backlog as a first‑class input when preparing for a new issue:\n+\n+1. **Scan the backlog.**  Before accepting a new active issue, look through `state/*/*/open/*.md` (and any `active/` files) to determine whether the work is already recorded.  If the item is new, prompt the user to create a backlog stub and, if details are immature, append `-ungroomed` to the filename so it will be picked up by the unplanned‑work check above.\n+\n+2. **Prioritise/current sprint awareness.**  If the issue should be executed in the current sprint rather than a future one, the agent should remind the user to move it into the `active/` folder for that sprint and, if necessary, update the ordering metadata (either by renaming or by editing the `depends-on` list) so it appears in the correct position relative to other active items.\n+\n+3. **Reordering the backlog.**  When new information arrives that changes the priority of existing backlog items, the agent can suggest editing the issue filenames or the `plan.md` of the parent sprint/milestone to reflect the new order.  For example, it may propose inserting an `order:` frontmatter field or adjust the list in `plan.md`.\n+\n+4. **Documentation.**  Record these checks and any recommendations in the intake output so that a human reviewer can verify the backlog state and take corrective action before implementation begins.\n+\n+These enhancements ensure that the agent not only scopes the active issue but also helps groom the backlog and adjust sprint ordering when necessary.\n*** End Patch\nPATCH",
